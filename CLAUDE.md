# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

The main application is located in the `portfolio-site/` directory. Always change to this directory before running commands:

```bash
cd portfolio-site
```

### Core Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (runs on localhost:5173)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

### Dependencies Management
- `npm install` - Install all dependencies
- Dependencies are managed via npm with package-lock.json for version locking

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **React 18.2.0** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite 4.5.0** as build tool and dev server
- **React Router DOM 6.8.0** for routing (though currently uses hash navigation)
- **Modern CSS** with CSS custom properties for theming
- **ESLint** for code quality

### Application Structure
This is a single-page application (SPA) with a section-based navigation system:

```
App.jsx (Router wrapper)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header.jsx (Fixed navigation with smooth scrolling)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Hero.jsx (Landing section with personal intro)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ About.jsx (Skills, experience, statistics)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects.jsx (Portfolio showcase with filtering)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Contact.jsx (Contact form and information)
```

### Component Patterns

#### State Management
- Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for local state
- No global state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- Each component manages its own state independently

#### Navigation System
- Hash-based navigation with smooth scrolling via `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
- Navigation controlled by `Header.jsx` component
- Each section has an `id` attribute for scroll targeting

#### Animation System
- Uses **Intersection Observer API** for scroll-triggered animations
- Animation classes are added via `entry.target.classList.add('animate')`
- CSS handles the actual animation transitions

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation in Header component
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

### CSS Architecture
- **Component-scoped CSS files** in `src/styles/` directory
- **CSS custom properties** for consistent theming in `App.css`
- **No CSS frameworks** (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) - custom CSS only
- Import pattern: `import '../styles/ComponentName.css'`

### Key Implementation Details

#### Header Component
- Tracks scroll position to add/remove `scrolled` class
- Mobile hamburger menu with `isMenuOpen` state
- Smooth scrolling navigation to page sections

#### Hero Component
- Personal information hardcoded (name: "Cormac O'Connor")
- Intersection Observer for animation triggers
- Profile placeholder using emoji (üë®‚Äçüíª)

#### Projects Component
- **Filtering system** with categories: 'all', 'frontend', 'backend', 'fullstack'
- **Featured projects** can be highlighted with `featured: true`
- **Sample projects** are hardcoded in component (replace with real projects)
- Uses placeholder images from `/api/placeholder/400/250`

#### Performance Considerations
- Intersection Observer for efficient scroll animations
- No lazy loading implemented yet
- No image optimization beyond placeholders

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Projects
Edit `src/components/Projects.jsx` and update the `projects` array with real project data.

### Customizing Personal Information
- **Hero section**: Update name, title, and description in `src/components/Hero.jsx`
- **About section**: Update skills, statistics, and bio in `src/components/About.jsx`
- **Contact section**: Update contact information in `src/components/Contact.jsx`

### Styling Changes
- **Global theme colors**: Modify CSS custom properties in `src/App.css`
- **Component styles**: Edit individual CSS files in `src/styles/`
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Currently uses 768px for mobile/desktop split

### Building and Deployment
The project includes AWS S3 deployment configuration via GitHub Actions, but the workflow file is referenced in documentation only.

## File Structure Notes
- Main app code in `portfolio-site/src/`
- Components in `portfolio-site/src/components/`
- Styles in `portfolio-site/src/styles/`
- Public assets in `portfolio-site/public/`
- Build output goes to `portfolio-site/dist/`

## Important Implementation Notes
- No TypeScript - uses plain JavaScript with JSX
- No testing framework configured
- Router is imported but navigation uses scroll-to-section instead of routing
- Form handling in Contact component is placeholder (no backend integration)
- All project images are placeholder URLs that need to be replaced
